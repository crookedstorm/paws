# PAWS

PAWS: A Web Shell (PAWS) is a Jupyter notebooks deployment that has been customized to make interacting with Wikimedia wikis easier. It allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, visualizations such as graphs, rich text, etc. The user created notebooks are a powerful tool that enables data analysis and scientific research, and also transforms the way in which programmers write code - by enabling an exploratory environment with a quick feedback loop, and a low barrier for entry through it's easy to use graphical interface. 

How to contribute? Just simply clone on your computer by writing the following command: 

` git clone https://github.com/toolforge/paws.git `

`cd paws`

PAWS provides some very core features on top of which people can build stuff.
Notebooks

It provides Jupyter notebooks (previously known as IPython Notebooks)

## Useful libraries
### Accessing Database Replicas With Pandas and Sqlalchemy

Pandas is a lovely high level library for in-memory data manipulations. In order to get the result of a SQL query as a pandas dataframe use:
```
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import sys, os
import pandas as pd

constr = 'mysql+pymysql://{user}:{pwd}@{host}'.format(user=os.environ['MYSQL_USERNAME'],
                                                      pwd=os.environ['MYSQL_PASSWORD'],
                                                      host=os.environ['MYSQL_HOST'])
con = create_engine(constr)

df = pd.read_sql('select * from plwiki_p.logging limit 10', con)
```
### Storage space
Publishing space

A notebook can be turned into a public notebook by publishing a link to it. This works as the notebook is made available in a read only mode. An example might be …revisions-sql.ipynb?kernel_name=python3. It could be wise to add the kernel name to the link, even if it isn't necessary in some cases.

If you want to run the copy yourself, or do interactive changes, you must download the notebook and reupload on your own account. Downloading the raw format of the previous example can be done by adding format=raw to the previous example …revisions-sql.ipynb?format=raw. This download-reupload-process is somewhat awkward.

Note that a notebook will always be published, as the link can be guessed, so don't add any private information.
